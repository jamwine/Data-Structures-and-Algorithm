    "## 642. Design Search Autocomplete System\n",
    "```\n",
    "Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. Users may input a sentence (at least one word and end with a special character '#'). For each character they type except '#', you need to return the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed. Here are the specific rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "The hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly same sentence before.\n",
    "The returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is the hottest one). If several sentences have the same degree of hot, you need to use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).\n",
    "\n",
    "If less than 3 hot sentences exist, then just return as many as you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you need to return an empty list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the constructor function:\n",
    "\n",
    "AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times): This is the constructor. The input is historical data. Sentences is a string array consists of previously typed sentences. Times is the corresponding times a sentence has been typed. Your system should record these historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the user wants to input a new sentence. The following function will provide the next character the user types:\n",
    "\n",
    "List<String> input(char c): The input c is the next character typed by the user. The character will only be lower-case letters ('a' to 'z'), blank space (' ') or a special character ('#'). Also, the previously typed sentence should be recorded in your system. The output will be the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Operation: AutocompleteSystem([\"i love you\", \"island\",\"ironman\", \"i love leetcode\"], [5,3,2,2])\n",
    "The system have already tracked down the following sentences and their corresponding times:\n",
    "\"i love you\" : 5 times\n",
    "\"island\" : 3 times\n",
    "\"ironman\" : 2 times\n",
    "\"i love leetcode\" : 2 times\n",
    "Now, the user begins another search:\n",
    "\n",
    "Operation: input('i')\n",
    "Output: [\"i love you\", \"island\",\"i love leetcode\"]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "There are four sentences that have prefix \"i\". Among them, \"ironman\" and \"i love leetcode\" have same hot degree. Since ' ' has ASCII code 32 and 'r' has ASCII code 114, \"i love leetcode\" should be in front of \"ironman\". Also we only need to output top 3 hot sentences, so \"ironman\" will be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operation: input(' ')\n",
    "Output: [\"i love you\",\"i love leetcode\"]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "There are only two sentences that have prefix \"i \".\n",

    "Operation: input('a')\n",
    "Output: []\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "There are no sentences that have prefix \"i a\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Operation: input('#')\n",
    "Output: []\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The user finished the input, the sentence \"i a\" should be saved as a historical sentence in system. And the following input will be counted as a new search.\n",
    " \n",
    "Note:\n",
